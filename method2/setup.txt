#METHOD II
#Here you generate a certificate and add it to both the client and servers certificate pool before communicating. 
#This seems simpler which is true, but Method I is closer to what happens in practice.
#
#Generate a certificate and a private key (single step process)
openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout cert.key -out cert.crt -subj '/CN=localhost' -days 365
